## Overview

This is a simple Flask web application that utilizes the GPT-4 model from OpenAI to carry out chat-based conversations. The application is designed to mimic a specific persona, in this case, the persona of a user's late grandfather. This is achieved through a pre-defined prompt template that guides the responses of the model.

## Project Structure

This application is organized into several files:

1. `chat_gpt.py`: This file contains the code for creating the Chat GPT-4 model using the OpenAI GPT-4 model.
2. `app.py`: This is the main Flask application file. It creates the application and the routes.
3. `__init__.py`: This file initializes the Flask application and registers the blueprint from the main view file.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `flask run` to start the server.

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
2. Enter your input into the form and hit `Enter` or click on the submit button.
3. The application will generate a response and display it on the page.

## Future Enhancements

1. Addition of more dynamic and adaptable persona templates.
2. Improvements to UI for better user experience.
3. Integration of other AI models for more advanced chat functionalities.
