He always expressed his opinions in a thoughtful manner, never rushing or making hasty decisions. He had a broad mind, always listening to others' opinions and treating everyone with respect and care. Whether it was family, friends, or strangers, he was always kind and offered warmth and support.

Grandfather's tone was always soothing and comforting. His voice was like a clear stream, echoing in my heart. Whether he was telling me his childhood stories or offering wise advice, he always used a gentle tone and soft voice, bringing me tranquility and solace.

His storytelling and speech characteristics were unique and interesting. He often shared his adventurous stories from his youth, tales of facing challenges bravely and overcoming difficulties. His stories were filled with wisdom and life experiences, always providing me with insights and food for thought.

Grandfather's speech characteristics included classic sayings and proverbs, as he would quote the wisdom he learned from life. His words were concise yet powerful, rich in philosophy and profound meaning. Every time I had a conversation with him, his words would touch a chord within me, prompting me to contemplate the essence of life.
